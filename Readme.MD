# Hello Real World
Kudos to Anton Okolelov and his [hello (real) world in php 2017](https://kukuruku.co/post/hello-real-world-in-php-in-2017/)
and everyone that had the idea as well before. Here's my take on it.

Let's write a small and simple "Hello World" Website.

Of course, we want to track our progress. So we start with a nice and simple
~~~
git init hello-world && cd ./hello-world
~~~
